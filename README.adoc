= Falling Down & Rising Up


== *Falling Down*

[%hardbreaks]
Growing up too fast,
I'm the top of my class,
no time to have a blast,
pushed for an A pass.
 +
Lazy results in inefficiency,
so Einstein becomes a lumberjack.
Pushed for proficiency,
of all trades; I am Jack.
 +
What lies behind my youthful laughter,
but all those disguised implications,
causing so many a lost chapter,
why come now these new revelations?
 +
My mind becomes fore frantic,
perhaps I must `panic!("Help me...);`


== *Building Up*

    };

    // From the dark and desperate, I must rise up
    me = me.rise_up();

    /*
    My hope may not shimmer like a diamond,
    I may hate myself,
    though what is for sure,
    but my persistance to perfect;

    start();

    My perfection which causes burnout so,
    may it be fueled by hearty maple,
    may it shimmer and glow,
    my kindling give way to something stable;
